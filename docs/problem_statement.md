# Problem Statement

IT Service Management (ITSM) teams rely on incident data to monitor service performance, ensure SLA compliance, and identify operational bottlenecks. However, in many organizations, incident data is:

- Inconsistent across multiple timestamps and states  
- Difficult to aggregate for SLA and resolution metrics  
- Lacking standardized KPIs for performance tracking  
- Not structured for analytical or dashboarding use cases  

As a result, teams struggle to:
- Accurately measure Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR)
- Identify SLA breach patterns
- Monitor incident aging and backlog health
- Perform trend analysis across priority, category, and time

### Objective
The objective of this project is to transform raw ITSM incident logs into a clean, analytics-ready dataset and define standardized KPIs that enable:

- Reliable SLA and resolution analysis  
- Operational performance monitoring  
- Scalable reporting through SQL and Power BI  
- A foundation for future predictive and machine learning use cases  

This project simulates a real-world ITSM analytics scenario commonly encountered in enterprise IT operations.
